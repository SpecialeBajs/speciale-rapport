\section{Conclusion}
In this work we changed the design of the layer combination for LightGCN and performed studies that showed the improvement of our method.
We proposed ALC and BLC, which on some datasets showed large improvements and on other datasets showed small differences.
ALC and BLC does layer combination based on how well each layer performed.
We also showed that in some cases it is better just to use one single convolution layer as the final embedding.
ALC and BLC was also used on node degrees, and this did not show improvements compared to ALC and BLC without considering the degree of nodes.
This should be something to consider for others deciding to continue working on weighted summation layer combination.\\
A GCF ablation study was also conducted to investigate which parts of the model increase performance.
It was inconclusive which of the methods performed best, as it depended on the dataset.
LightGCN with the ALC and BLC extension were however able to consistently outperform GCF.\\
We believe that ALC and BLC can be used as inspiration for future research into optimizing layer combination, as it showcases that there is room for improvements on different datasets.
