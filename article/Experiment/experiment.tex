\section{Experiment}
Throughout this section we perform experiments to answer the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1}: How does changing $\alpha_k$ affect the performance in LightGCN?
    \item \textbf{RQ2}: How do different aggregation functions effect the performance in GCF and LightGCN?
    \item \textbf{RQ3}: How does adding ALC and BLC to LightGCN perform compared to other state of the art methods?
    \item \textbf{RQ4}: Is it beneficial to change layer combination based on the degree of the nodes?
\end{itemize}
