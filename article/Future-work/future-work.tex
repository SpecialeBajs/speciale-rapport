\section{Future work}
We have several ideas for future work.
There are obviously many alternative methods to calculate the weighted summation layer combinations other than ALC and BLC that could be worth investigated.
Additionally these layer combinations could be based on information about the dataset, so that it is not necessary to run each layer individually.
Alternatively the layer combination can be based on recall or an alternative evaluation measurement instead of NDCG@50 as we have used.
These weights in layer combination that determine the importance of each layer could also be parameters that were to be learned.
We tried adding one weight matrix to LightGCN and used different layer combinations in Appendix \ref{app:lightgcn-1-weight} to see if it with this way could learn the layer combination, but this method did not show good results.
Furthermore, additional investigation into how the number of connections a user indirectly has effects how layer combination should be done could lead to further improvements.


% Gør så den selv kan lave effects baseret på datasæt / lære dem selv
% Find en måde at kunne lære / optimere effect
% Eksperiment with the number of connections a users indirectly has
