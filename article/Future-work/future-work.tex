\section{Future work}
We have several ideas for future work.
There are obviously other methods to calculate the weighted summation layer combinations that could be investigated.
Additionally these layer combinations could be based on information about the dataset, so that it is not necessary to run each layer individually.
These parameters in layer combination could also be parameters that were to be learned.
We tried adding one weight to LightGCN and used different layer combinations in Appendix \ref{app:lightgcn-1-weight} to see if it with this way could learn the layer combination, but this method did not show good results.
Furthermore, additional investigation into how the number of connections a user indirectly has effects how layer combination should be done could lead to further improvements.


% Gør så den selv kan lave effects baseret på datasæt / lære dem selv
% Find en måde at kunne lære / optimere effect
% Eksperiment with the number of connections a users indirectly has
