Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) is a State-of-the-Art method used for recommendation.
Throughout this paper we suggest two new alternative extensions for LightGCN called Aggressive Layer Combination (ALC) and Balanced Layer Combination (BLC).
These are used as alternative layer combination methods for graph convolutional networks instead of using means.
This showed large improvements on datasets where items have few connections and users have a larger amount of connections.
We also conduct an ablation study for GCF to understand why it outperformed LightGCN on their datasets.
Both ALC and BLC showed to outperform GCF.
Additionally we experimented with some edge cases, where only one embedding layer were used and only removing the 0th embedding layer.
Only utilizing one embedding layer also showed in many cases to outperform ALC, BLC, GCF and LightGCN.
