Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) is a State-of-the-Art method used for recommendation.
Throughout this paper we suggest two new alternative extensions for LightGCN called Aggressive Layer Combination (ALC) and Balanced Layer Combination (BLC).
These are used as alternative layer combination methods for graph convolutional networks instead of using LightGCNs version of weighted summation.
This showed large improvements on datasets where items have few connections and users have a larger amount of connections.
An ablation study for GCF is also conducted to understand why it outperformed LightGCN on their datasets.
ALC and BLC both outperformed GCF.
Additionally, we experimented with some edge cases, where only one embedding layer was used or where the 0th embedding is removed.
Only utilizing one embedding layer also showed in many cases to outperform ALC, BLC, GCF and LightGCN.
