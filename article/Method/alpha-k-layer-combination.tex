Before trying to optimize $\alpha_k$ we wanted to investigate what impact it had.
The simplest experiment is to remove it.
If this results in small changes in performance, it could indicate that it would not be worthwhile to pursue the opportunity to optimize $\alpha_k$.
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{e}_u = \sum_{k=0}^{K} \mathbf{e}_u^{(k)},
    \label{eq:lightgcn-sum}
\end{equation}
The result of the experiment can be seen in \autoref{subsubsec:remove-alpha-k}

\subsubsection{Optimizing $\alpha_k$}
% Definer matematikken
The initial idea of optimizing $\alpha_k$ was to change each layer's effect depending on how many connections each node has.
An example can be seen \autoref{tab:alpha-example}.
The numbers shown on the table are arbitrary and different variables need to be tested to see how well it performs.
The intuition behind this is that the effect of each layer in the GCN being dependent on the number of connections that the node has would be beneficial.
A node with only 1 connection will not benefit much from the first convolution but will be richer in information in the third convolution.
For a node with 200 connections, the third convolution might actually be harmful, as the node gets impacted too much by too many nodes, where 1 convolution is enough to make it perform optimally.
