\section{Method}
Throughout this section we introduce ALC and BLC as our contribution to LightGCN.
These methods experiment with different changes to how layer combination is performed in LightGCN.
We also describe some edge cases when changing $\alpha_k$ such as removing the 0th embedding and only utilizing one layer.
