\section{Method}
Throughout this section we introduce the different methods that we developed as our contribution to LightGCN.
The methods experiment with different changes to how layer combination is performed in LightGCN.
This includes changing $\alpha_k$ to different variables, as well as conducting an GCF ablation study. 
This ablation study introduces the different methods that were developed to understand the impact of the different parts of GCF.
Two specific layer combinations methods are proposed to improve layer combination in LightGCN, and finally model training is described.
